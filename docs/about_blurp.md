# What is LibreWolf?

LibreWolf is just like Firefox, but it has all the recommended security setings and add-ons built in for you.

To be technical, LibreWolf, in essence, is two files:

* [librewolf.cfg](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/settings/-/blob/master/librewolf.cfg) - All the recomended privacy settings. 
* [policies.json](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/settings/-/blob/master/distribution/policies.json) - Install privacy add-ons, remove all big tech search engines, and makes duckduckgo the default search engine.

That's it the rest should be your normal Firefox. [[DOWNLOAD SETUP]]

## What else do I need to know?

* Librewolf installs on your machine as administrator, so you can't change everything you want. Certain things we consider just too unsafe: and then we keep that setting locked.
* Windows and macOS don't have automatic updates.
* We do make changes to the firefox source, but these are minor things.
* We don't like pocket. Sorry, you can't have your pocket. Or whatever cloud service.
* Updates are different per platform we deploy on.
