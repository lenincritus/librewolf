# What is LibreWolf?

LibreWolf is just like Firefox, but it has all the recommended security setings and add-ons built in for you.

To be technical, LibreWolf, in essence, is two files:

* [librewolf.cfg](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/settings/-/blob/master/librewolf.cfg) - All the recomended privacy settings. 
* [policies.json](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/settings/-/blob/master/distribution/policies.json) - Install add-ons, remove all search engines, and make duckduckgo the default search engine.

That's it the rest should be your normal Firefox.
