# Merge Request (MR) how-to

This page is ment to document how to edit something, using an MR, on the [LibreWolf website](https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io/).

I'm a big proponent of editing the .md files right in the Gitlab website, no need to clone the files locally or any of that complicated stuff, it can all be done from the website, using a comfortable markdown editor which has a Write/Preview pane, bold and italics buttons, link buttons, most of the stuff we need. Also, it will make the MR merge process much easier and non-technical.
